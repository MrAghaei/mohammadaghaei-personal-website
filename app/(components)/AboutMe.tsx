            My journey in development began with Java, which sparked a deep
            interest in programming. I ventured into game development with Unity
            and Unreal Engine, eventually working as a game designer at a studio
            for 1.5 years. In 2023, I transitioned into front-end development,
            where I now combine design and code to build intuitive, engaging
            user interfaces. Iâ€™m currently focused on portfolio projects with my
            team.
