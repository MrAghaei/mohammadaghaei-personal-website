            My journey in development started with learning Java, which sparked
            my interest in programming. I explored game development with Unity
            and Unreal Engine, eventually working as a game designer at a game
            studio for 1.5 years. In 2023, I decided to shift my focus to
            front-end development, where I combine my background in design and
            coding to create intuitive and engaging web experiences. I&#39;m
            currently working on portfolio projects with my own team.
